# Customer Churn Prediction Project

### Objective:
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.

### Tools & Technologies:
- SQL (for data preprocessing & extraction)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
- Accuracy Achieved: **69%**

### Workflow:
1. Data extraction using SQL
2. Data cleaning & EDA in Python
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
5. Evaluation using Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

### Outcome:
Helps businesses identify and retain at-risk customers.
