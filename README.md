# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using SQL and Python. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take informed steps to improve retention and revenue.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction and preprocessing  
- **Python** – EDA, visualization, and model building  
- **ML Models** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Libraries** – Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **SMOTE** – Used to handle class imbalance and improve model performance  

## 📊 Project Overview
- Extracted and cleaned customer data using SQL  
- Explored churn patterns across gender, age groups, and monthly revenue trends  
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE to improve model accuracy from low to **69%**  
- Built and evaluated churn prediction models using logistic regression and random forest  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female customers had a slightly higher churn rate than males  
- The senior citizen group (ages 50–100) contributed the most to total revenue  
- Churn rate was slightly higher in the Clothing and Books categories  
- Monthly revenue remained stable, showing consistent customer engagement  

## 📁 Deliverables
- SQL query files  
- Python notebooks for EDA and machine learning
